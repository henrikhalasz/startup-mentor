Bel

Oct 2019
Bel is a spec for a new dialect of Lisp, written in itself. This should sound familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's 
the way Lisp began
.
It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a 
guide to the Bel language
, and the 
Bel source
.
For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a 
file of those
. But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in itself.
Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel, there are bound to be more remaining. So this first version is version C, after Cunningham's Law.
